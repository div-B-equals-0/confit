* Notebooks
- These will be used for exploration and demonstration of the code, plus producing graphics output
- Although I do not want to put too much code in them, anything useful should be moved to the library

** Converting notebooks to python scripts
- I can use ~nbconvert~ for this
- Do I want to automate this?

* Testing

** Testing my library code with ~pytest~

** Testing a set of notebooks with ~pytest~ and ~nbval~
- See [[https://semaphoreci.com/blog/test-jupyter-notebooks-with-pytest-and-nbmake]["How to Test Jupyter Notebooks with Pytest and Nbmake"]] by Alex Remedios

** Testing functions within a notebook with ~ipytest~
- See [[https://medium.com/@mefengl/using-pytest-in-jupyter-notebooks-a-practical-guide-1ba8e02af288]["Using Pytest in Jupyter Notebooks: A Practical Guide"]] by Mefeng Lin
* Requirements
- do I want to use a requirements.txt file?
- or pyproject.toml?
* Packaging
** What sort of system should I use?
- I have previously tried poetry, but there seem to be a lot more options these days
* Documentation
** TODO Building a prettier version of docs for github
- The org files are great for use within emacs, but github doesn't render them nicely
  - In particular, it does not support mathjax latex rendering
- I could maybe export to markdown, but at that point I might as well export to html
